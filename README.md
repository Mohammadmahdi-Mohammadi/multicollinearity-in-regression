# multicollinearity-in-regression
Consider the Fish.csv dataset (target variable is “Weight”) then answer the following questions.
For report accuracy model you should report R-Squared and R-Squared Prediction. you don’t need
to split data. For all parts, you must explain the steps to solve the question:

a) Run linear regression and report the accuracy.

b) Run all-possible regression and report the accuracy table. Which one has the highest
accuracy?

c) Run Stepwise method on this data set. Report the accuracy. Is the variable selected in
stepwise different from the best result in the all-possible regression?

d) Does this dataset have multicollinearity problem? Show and explain.

e) Report DFFITS and Cook’s distance plot. Interpret these plots.

f) Analyze the residual error. Is it normal? If not, fix the problem and measure the accuracy
again. Does normalizing the residual error fix the Heteroscedasticity problem?

g) Considering all the above, build your final model and report the accuracy. Accuracy above
99% has extra points. (Hint: you should use polynomial regression and variables
interaction effect)
